# Simon-Says-Game

Welcome to the Simon Says Game! <br>This project is a digital recreation of the classic memory game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play<br>
The game will present a sequence of colors, and your goal is to repeat the sequence in the correct order.

--> Start the Game: Press a key to start the game, a color will flash on the screen.<br>
--> Memorize the Sequence: Each round, a new color is added to the sequence. Watch carefully and memorize the order.<br>
--> Repeat the Sequence: Click on the colors in the same order as they were presented. If you get it right, you move on to the next round.<br>
--> Game Over: If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and you'll have to start over.<br>
The sequence gets longer with each round, challenging your memory and focus. How far can you go?
